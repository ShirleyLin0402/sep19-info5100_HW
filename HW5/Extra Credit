The answer should be 6.

When created item b,
call b.addAll()------>the addCount = 3, since the list.size()=3;
when it returns super.addAll(c), it calls the addAll method in A.
Since the list has three elements which means the while loop goes three time, 
this.add(), call the add method in class B, so the addCount++ goes for 3 times.

Then the addCount=3+1+1+1=6;
b.getAddCount()=6

while b.getI()=0, since the getI() method has not been overwritten in classB, i = 0;
Therefore the answer should be 6.
