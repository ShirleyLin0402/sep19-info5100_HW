Q9.Explain Encapsulation with an example. (Write at least 30-40 words).

We need to build setter methods for every instance variable.
For example, we need to have the maximum speed of the vehicle.

Instead of writing "theCar.maxSpeed = 150;", which means someone else can make a direct
change to the maximum speed of car,such that "theCar.maxSpeed = -1;", which is an unacceptable information.

We need to build a setter method i.e
public void setMaxSpeed(int speed){
    if (speed > 0){
        maxSpeed = speed;
    }
}

To force other code to call the setter instead of access the data directly.


Q10. What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction
Encapsulation is hiding the data and code into a single unit, to protect the work from directly access from outside.
Abstraction allows us to focus on what the object does instead of how.

Abstraction focus on what should be done, while Encapsulation focus on how it should be done.
Abstraction is applied in design level, while Encapsulation is applied in implementation level.
